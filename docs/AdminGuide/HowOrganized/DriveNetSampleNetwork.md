# The DRIVENET sample network

## The benefits of a sample network

The administration guide makes use of a sample network called DRIVENET.  When concepts are introduced, you'll see how they relate to a real-world, easy-to-understand example - DRIVENET.  

If you're new to blockchains or Hyperledger Fabric, DRIVENET will allow you to understand key concepts by relating them to DRIVENET. For example you'll understand organizations, channels, smart contracts or peers by understanding how they appear in DRIVENET, and why they are important. It means that your learning will be grounded in a real example.

There's also a full step-by-step guide which sets up DRIVENET so that you can try out the Concepts and Tasks that you've learned. You'll be able to see the components you've learned about running in a live network.  This will give you the confidence

Finally, even in the more general information sections such as [Administrative Tasks](./), [Reference Material](./) or [Glossary of Terms](./), there will be pointers back to DRIVENET to remind you of a concrete example.

## The DRIVENET scenario

**DRIVENET** is a blockchain network, where Mitchell, a car manufacturer in Detroit, and Regal, a manufacturer in Kentucky, come together to form a network to streamline information and processes related to their businesses. They decide that they will have equal and shared administrative rights over the network and will design it, in part, to interact with applications that will track car production and distribution.

After setting up the initial network, Mitchell and Regal will invite Cecil’s – a car dealership in Decatur, Illinois, who sells both types of cars – to DRIVENET. Mitchell and Regal are also required to invite the DMV to DRIVENET to ensure that cars are registered properly and that changes of ownership are recorded. These new parties will participate fully in the network, but with fewer administration rights. Developers at Cecil’s and the DMV write applications to sell cars and register their usage on DRIVENET.

Mitchell and Regal will later expand DRIVENET to include ZBS Insurance, who will offer insurance plans to Cecil’s customers. Separately, Regal invites Faster Autos, from Miami, Florida, who only sells Regal cars – which it receives at a significantly reduced price – to the network. Faster Autos also wants to make ZBS insurance plans available to its customers and will – like Cecil’s – employ developers to write applications to manage their plans.
