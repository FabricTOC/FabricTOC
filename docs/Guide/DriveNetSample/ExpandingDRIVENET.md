# The DRIVENET Sample Network

## Expanding DRIVENET


Mitchell and Regal will later expand DRIVENET to include ZBS Insurance, who will offer insurance plans to Cecil’s customers. Separately, Regal invites Faster Autos, from Miami, Florida, who only sells Regal cars – which it receives at a significantly reduced price – to the network. Faster Autos also wants to make ZBS insurance plans available to its customers and will – like Cecil’s – employ developers to write applications to manage their plans.
